# Multi-Modal Enhancement of CT Images using MRI-T1 Data: An ADVERSARIAL DIFFUSION APPROACH

## Abstract


## Introduction

In the ever-evolving domain of Computer Vision, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have set significant benchmarks in image generation. However, with the rise of intricate domains like medical imaging, the field has witnessed the emergence of diffusion models, signaling a paradigm shift. SynDiff, a model tailored for medical image synthesis, leverages the strengths of diffusion techniques and aims to address the challenges posed by the Medical Image Generative Quadrilemma.

## Key Highlights

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: GANs, comprising of a Generator and a Discriminator, set benchmarks in image generation.
  
- **Challenges in Medical Imaging**: GANs face issues like mode collapse, risking the accuracy of medical images. The Medical Image Generative Quadrilemma introduces anatomical fidelity as a key component in addition to the traditional generative learning trilemma.

- **Rise of Diffusion Models**: Models such as DALL-E, Imagen, and SDXL showcase the strengths of diffusion techniques, capturing intricate data distributions and excelling in grasping diverse aspects of data.

- **Inpainting and Imputation**: Emphasizes restoring missing or damaged sections of images, pivotal in fields like image restoration, art, and scientific research.

- **Multi-modal Translation**: Holds significant importance in medical imaging, promising time and cost savings, and enhancing image quality.

- **SynDiff Model**: This study introduces SynDiff, an adversarial diffusion model tailored for medical image synthesis. SynDiff uses conditional diffusion to produce the desired target image, offering efficiency with a larger step size. It integrates both diffusive and non-diffusive processes and has been extensively tested on multi-contrast MRI-CT translations.

- **Focus on Bile Duct Tissue**: Demonstrating SynDiff's efficacy, the model aims to enhance the visibility of the bile duct in CT scans by leveraging MRI data.
